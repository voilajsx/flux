# FLUX Framework Feature Specification Guide v3.1

## üéØ **The FLUX Feature Creation System**

FLUX Framework enables **95% agentic development** through precise human-controlled specifications that guide AI agents in generating production-ready code.

### **Three-File Human Specification System**

```yaml
{feature}.requirements.yml     # Human: Business requirements & user stories
{feature}.instructions.yml     # Human: Agent execution instructions
{feature}.specification.json   # Human: Technical specifications & patterns
```

### **Two-File Agent Reporting System**

```yaml
{feature}.compliance.json      # Agent: Generated compliance tracking
{feature}.actions.log          # Agent: Real-time execution progress
```

## üìã Requirements.yml - Business Requirements

### Purpose

Define WHAT to build and WHY it matters. This file answers: "What business value does this feature provide?"

### Philosophy

- **User-focused** - Every feature solves real user problems
- **Measurable outcomes** - Success criteria are specific and trackable
- **Business clarity** - Clear business rules and constraints
- **Acceptance-driven** - Precise acceptance criteria for each story

### Schema Structure

#### üî¥ REQUIRED FIELDS (Must Have)

```yaml
name: string # Feature identifier (lowercase, hyphens)
description: string # One-line business description
version: string # Semantic version (1.0.0)
purpose: string # Why this feature exists
user_stories: array # What users want to accomplish
```

**Why Required:** Agents need clear business context to make implementation decisions.

#### üü° RECOMMENDED FIELDS (Should Have)

```yaml
owner: string # Who's responsible
created: string/date # When created
business_value: string # Business impact
target_users: string # Who uses this
priority: enum # low|medium|high|critical
core_features: object # Main feature breakdown
business_rules: array # Business constraints
success_metrics: object # How to measure success
```

**Why Recommended:** Provides business context that improves agent decision-making.

#### üü¢ OPTIONAL FIELDS (Nice to Have)

```yaml
last_updated: string/date # Change tracking
constraints: array # Technical/business limits
assumptions: array # Planning assumptions
business_risks: object # Risk mitigation plans
technical_requirements: object # Complex feature needs
rollout: object # Deployment strategy
```

**Why Optional:** Adds detail for complex features without overwhelming simple ones.

### Writing Guidelines

#### User Stories Best Practices

```yaml
user_stories:
  # ‚úÖ GOOD - Clear actor, action, benefit
  - story: 'As a customer, I want to track my order status so I can plan accordingly'
    acceptance: 'Show real-time order updates with delivery estimates'
    example: 'Order #1234: In Transit - Arriving Tuesday 3-5 PM'

  # ‚ùå AVOID - Vague, no clear benefit
  - story: 'Users need order tracking'
    acceptance: 'Show orders'
    example: 'List of orders'
```

#### Business Rules Clarity

```yaml
business_rules:
  # ‚úÖ GOOD - Specific, actionable
  - 'Orders over $100 qualify for free shipping'
  - 'Customers must verify email before first purchase'
  - 'Refunds allowed within 30 days of delivery'

  # ‚ùå AVOID - Vague, unactionable
  - 'Handle orders properly'
  - 'Users should be happy'
  - 'Follow business processes'
```

### LLM Generation Prompt

```

## üéØ File Relationships and Workflow

### How Files Work Together

```
Requirements.yml (Business Intent)
    ‚Üì
Specification.json (Technical Specs)
    ‚Üì
Instructions.yml (Execution Plan)
    ‚Üì
Agent Execution ‚Üí Generated Code
```

### Cross-File Validation

**Name Consistency:**

- `requirements.name` = `instructions.feature` = `specification.feature`

**Story-to-Endpoint Mapping:**

- Each user story should map to specific endpoints in specification.json
- Agent tasks should cover all endpoints defined in specification.json

**Version Alignment:**

- All three files should maintain consistent version numbers
- Update versions together when making changes

### Quality Checklist

#### Before Agent Execution

- [ ] All three files validate against schemas
- [ ] Feature names match across all files
- [ ] User stories map to specification endpoints
- [ ] Agent tasks cover all required work
- [ ] Business logic is clearly specified
- [ ] Validation commands are complete

#### After Agent Execution

- [ ] All validation pipelines pass
- [ ] Generated code matches specifications
- [ ] Test coverage meets targets
- [ ] Business logic is correctly implemented
- [ ] Security requirements are satisfied

## üìö Schema Validation

All files must pass schema validation before agent execution:

```bash
# Validate individual schemas
npm run flux:validate schema:requirements
npm run flux:validate schema:instructions
npm run flux:validate schema:specification

# Validate all schemas and cross-references
npm run flux:validate all
```

**Why Schema Validation Matters:**

- Prevents agent execution with incomplete specifications
- Ensures consistency across all feature files
- Catches specification errors before code generation
- Provides clear error messages for quick fixes
