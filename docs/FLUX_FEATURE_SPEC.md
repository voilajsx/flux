# FLUX Framework Feature Specification Guide

> **The definitive guide for creating perfect FLUX Framework feature specifications that enable 95% agentic development with 100% reliability**

## üéØ Why This Document Exists

**Problem:** Agents fail when given unclear specifications. Vague requirements lead to wrong code, missing tests, and deployment failures.

**Solution:** FLUX Framework uses 3 precisely structured files that give agents perfect clarity:

- **Blueprint** - WHAT to build (business requirements)
- **Agent** - HOW to build it (execution instructions)
- **Implementation** - EXACTLY what to build (technical specifications)

**Result:** 95% agent autonomy with mathematical reliability guarantees.

## üìã The Three-File System

### Why Three Files?

**Separation of Concerns:**

- **Humans excel at:** Business strategy, user needs, execution planning
- **Agents excel at:** Code generation, testing, compliance validation
- **System excels at:** Technical specifications, validation rules

**File Responsibilities:**

```
Blueprint.yml     ‚Üí Business person writes user stories
Agent.yml         ‚Üí Technical lead writes execution plan
Implementation.json ‚Üí System/human writes technical specs
```

**Mathematical Isolation:** Each file serves a single purpose, preventing conflicts and ensuring clarity.

## üìù Blueprint.yml - Business Requirements

### Purpose

Define WHAT to build and WHY from a business perspective. This file answers: "What problem are we solving for users?"

### Philosophy

- **Business-first thinking** - Start with user value, not technical solutions
- **Story-driven development** - Every feature must solve real user problems
- **Measurable outcomes** - Define success criteria upfront
- **Risk awareness** - Identify and plan for business risks

### Required Reading for Implementation Generation

**Before generating any implementation.json file, LLMs MUST read:**

1. **APPKIT_LLM_GUIDE.md** - Complete VoilaJSX AppKit patterns
   - Module initialization with .get() pattern
   - Error handling with semantic error types
   - Security patterns with secure.input()
   - Logging patterns with structured data
   - All available AppKit modules and their usage

2. **VOILA-COMMENT-GUIDELINES.md** - Code documentation standards
   - @llm-rule WHEN/AVOID/NOTE patterns
   - File header templates
   - Function documentation requirements
   - Module and method commenting standards

3. **FLUX_FOUNDATION_PRINCIPLES.md** - Framework architecture
   - Endpoint isolation principles
   - Contract-driven development
   - Mathematical reliability guarantees
   - 95% agentic + 5% human workflow

**Why This Matters:**

- Ensures consistent VoilaJSX patterns across all generated code
- Prevents common implementation mistakes
- Maintains FLUX Framework architectural principles
- Enables reliable agent code generation

### Writing Guidelines

#### User Stories Best Practices

```yaml
user_stories:
  # ‚úÖ GOOD - Clear actor, action, benefit
  - story: 'As a customer, I want to track my order status so I can plan accordingly'
    acceptance: 'Show real-time order updates with delivery estimates'
    example: 'Order #1234: In Transit - Arriving Tuesday 3-5 PM'

  # ‚ùå AVOID - Vague, no clear benefit
  - story: 'Users need order tracking'
    acceptance: 'Show orders'
    example: 'List of orders'
```

#### Business Rules Clarity

```yaml
business_rules:
  # ‚úÖ GOOD - Specific, actionable
  - 'Orders over $100 qualify for free shipping'
  - 'Customers must verify email before first purchase'
  - 'Refunds allowed within 30 days of delivery'

  # ‚ùå AVOID - Vague, unactionable
  - 'Handle orders properly'
  - 'Users should be happy'
  - 'Follow business processes'
```

    "admin: full access to all endpoints",
    "user: read-only access to own data",
    "guest: access to public endpoints only"
  ],
  "edge_cases": [
    "handle timezone differences for date calculations",
    "gracefully handle null/undefined user preferences",
    "retry failed external API calls with exponential backoff"
  ],
  "error_scenarios": [
    "invalid_email: return 400 with 'Invalid email format'",
    "duplicate_user: return 409 with 'Email already registered'",
    "server_error: return 500 with generic message, log details"
  ]
}
```

## üéØ File Relationships and Workflow

### How Files Work Together

```
Blueprint.yml (Business Intent)
    ‚Üì
Agent.yml (Execution Plan)
    ‚Üì
Implementation.json (Technical Specs)
    ‚Üì
Agent Execution ‚Üí Generated Code
```

### Cross-File Validation

**Name Consistency:**

- `blueprint.name` = `agent.feature` = `implementation.feature`

**Story-to-Endpoint Mapping:**

- Each user story should map to specific endpoints in implementation.json
- Agent tasks should cover all endpoints defined in implementation.json

**Version Alignment:**

- All three files should maintain consistent version numbers
- Update versions together when making changes

### Quality Checklist

#### Before Agent Execution

- [ ] All three files validate against schemas
- [ ] Feature names match across all files
- [ ] User stories map to implementation endpoints
- [ ] Agent tasks cover all required work
- [ ] Business logic is clearly specified
- [ ] Validation commands are complete

#### After Agent Execution

- [ ] All validation pipelines pass
- [ ] Generated code matches specifications
- [ ] Test coverage meets targets
- [ ] Business logic is correctly implemented
- [ ] Security requirements are satisfied

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Perfect FLUX Feature Specifications Achieve:

**95% Agent Reliability:**

- Agents get clear, unambiguous instructions
- Business logic is precisely specified
- Error scenarios are explicitly handled
- Validation gates prevent failures

**Mathematical Isolation:**

- Each feature is completely self-contained
- No cross-dependencies between features
- Changes to one feature don't affect others
- Deployment failures are impossible

**Human-Agent Collaboration:**

- Humans focus on business strategy and value
- Agents focus on technical implementation
- Clear handoff points with approval gates
- Audit trails for accountability

**Enterprise Quality:**

- 100% test coverage requirements
- Security patterns enforced automatically
- Performance targets specified upfront
- Compliance validation built-in

---

## üìö Schema Validation

All files must pass schema validation before agent execution:

```bash
# Validate individual schemas
npm run flux:validate schema:blueprint
npm run flux:validate schema:agent
npm run flux:validate schema:implementation

# Validate all schemas and cross-references
npm run flux:validate all
```

**Why Schema Validation Matters:**

- Prevents agent execution with incomplete specifications
- Ensures consistency across all feature files
- Catches specification errors before code generation
- Provides clear error messages for quick fixes

---

**Remember: Perfect specifications enable perfect code generation. Invest time in specification quality to achieve 95% agentic reliability.**
