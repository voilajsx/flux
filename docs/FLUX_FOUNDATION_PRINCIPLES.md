# VoilaJSX FLUX Framework - Foundation Principles v3.1

## 🎯 Core Foundation (Practical Reliability)

### 1. **100% Reliability Through Practical Isolation**

- ✅ **Endpoint Isolation**: Zero cross-dependencies between endpoints
- ✅ **Smart Folder Routing**: URL structure maps to folder structure
- ✅ **Breaking Change Prevention**: Practical guarantee of no side effects
- ✅ **Event-Only Communication**: No shared imports between endpoints

### 2. **Controlled Code Duplication with Intelligence**

- ✅ **Duplication Tracking**: {feature}.compliance.json contains detailed duplication analysis
- ✅ **Agent Decision Making**: AI reviews duplication and decides sync strategy
- ✅ **Acceptable Patterns**: VoilaJSX initialization, error handling, logging
- ✅ **Pattern Evolution**: Agent learns and improves patterns over time

### 3. **Four-File Architecture with Clear Human/Agent Control**

- ✅ **Human Files**: {feature}.requirements.yml (business) + {feature}.specification.json (specs) + {feature}.instructions.yml (tasks)
- ✅ **Agent Files**: {feature}.compliance.json (compliance) + {feature}.actions.log (progress) + endpoint code + manifests
- ✅ **Clear Ownership**: Humans design and specify, agents execute and report

### 4. **Contract-Driven Architecture**

```
src/api/{feature}/
├── {feature}.requirements.yml      # Human: Business requirements & user stories
├── {feature}.specification.json    # Human: Technical specs and patterns
├── {feature}.instructions.yml      # Human: Agent execution instructions
├── {feature}.compliance.json       # Agent: Generated compliance tracking
├── {feature}.actions.log           # Agent: Real-time execution progress
└── {endpoint}/
    ├── {endpoint}.contract.ts       # Agent: API specification
    ├── {endpoint}.logic.ts          # Agent: Business logic (<800 lines)
    ├── {endpoint}.test.ts           # Agent: Comprehensive tests
    └── {endpoint}.manifest.json     # Agent: Endpoint reliability report
```

### 5. **95% Agent + 5% Human Workflow**

- ✅ **Agent Documentation**: Framework guides, VoilaJSX patterns, human-defined specs
- ✅ **Human Oversight**: Requirements creation, specification writing, instruction definition, GitHub approval
- ✅ **Agent Execution**: Code generation based on human specifications + real-time compliance tracking
- ✅ **Action-Based Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking via actions.log

### 6. **Human-Controlled File Strategy**

```yaml
# Human creates (Business Intent):
hello.requirements.yml              # Business requirements

# Human creates (Technical Specs):
hello.specification.json            # VoilaJSX patterns, validation rules, endpoint specs

# Human creates (Execution Plan):
hello.instructions.yml              # Task instructions

# Agent generates (Compliance Tracking):
hello.compliance.json               # Cross-endpoint analysis, reliability scores, deployment status

# Agent creates (Execution Trail):
hello.actions.log                   # Step-by-step progress with timestamps
```

### 7. **Validation Pipeline for Reliability**

```bash
npm run flux:types     # TypeScript validation → logged to actions.log
npm run flux:lint      # Code standards → logged to actions.log
npm run flux:contract  # Contract compliance → logged to actions.log
npm run flux:test      # Functionality testing → logged to actions.log
npm run flux:compliance # Updates {feature}.compliance.json → logged to actions.log
npm run flux:check     # Full pipeline → logged to actions.log
```

### 8. **Human-Agent Interface Design**

```yaml
# HUMAN LAYER (Strategic + Technical)
{feature}.requirements.yml          # "What to build and why"
{feature}.specification.json        # "Technical specifications for building"
{feature}.instructions.yml          # "How agent should build it"

# AGENT LAYER (Execution + Reporting)
{feature}.compliance.json           # "Quality and compliance validation"
{feature}.actions.log               # "What I'm doing right now"
{endpoint}.contract.ts              # "API contracts I'm implementing"
{endpoint}.logic.ts                 # "Business logic I'm writing"
{endpoint}.test.ts                  # "Tests I'm creating"
{endpoint}.manifest.json            # "My work quality report"
```

### 9. **30x Development Speed Goal**

## 🔄 Human-Agent Interaction Flow

### **Core Interaction Model**

```
Human creates → Agent executes → Agent reports → Human approves
```

### **1. Creation Flow**

```bash
# Step 1: Human creates business intent and specifications
Human: Creates hello.requirements.yml (business requirements & user stories)
Human: Creates hello.specification.json (technical specifications)
Human: Creates hello.instructions.yml (step-by-step execution instructions)

# Step 2: Agent starts execution based on human specs
Agent: Reads hello.requirements.yml + hello.specification.json + hello.instructions.yml
Agent: Logs to hello.actions.log: "AGENT_CONFIG_PARSED tasks=10 endpoints=2"
Agent: Executes tasks sequentially with step-level logging
Agent: Generates hello.compliance.json with compliance metrics after each validation

# Step 3: Human monitors and approves
Human: Monitors tail -f hello.actions.log (real-time progress)
Human: Reviews agent-generated hello.compliance.json (compliance dashboard)
Human: Approves generated code in GitHub PR
```

### **2. Bug Fix Flow**

```bash
# Bug discovered in production
Bug: XSS vulnerability in @name endpoint

# Human intervention
Human: Adds task 11 to hello.instructions.yml:
  - name: 'fix_xss_vulnerability'
  - what: 'Strengthen input sanitization in @name endpoint'
Human: Updates hello.specification.json with new security requirements

# Agent execution
Agent: Reads updated hello.instructions.yml and hello.specification.json
Agent: Logs to hello.actions.log: "TASK_11_START security_fix_xss"
Agent: Modifies @name.logic.ts with enhanced validation
Agent: Updates hello.compliance.json with new security compliance metrics
Agent: Commits: "fix(hello): strengthen XSS protection"

# Human approval
Human: Reviews PR with security changes and updated hello.compliance.json
Human: Monitors hello.actions.log for "TASK_11_COMPLETE security_validated=true"
```

### **3. Feature Update Flow**

```bash
# New requirement: Add admin endpoint
Business: Admin-only greeting endpoint needed

# Human specification
Human: Updates hello.requirements.yml with admin user story
Human: Updates hello.specification.json with admin endpoint specs
Human: Updates hello.instructions.yml with admin endpoint tasks

# Agent execution
Agent: Detects hello.requirements.yml changes
Agent: Logs to hello.actions.log: "REQUIREMENTS_CHANGE_DETECTED new_endpoint=admin"
Agent: Creates admin/admin.contract.ts, admin.logic.ts, admin.test.ts
Agent: Updates hello.compliance.json with new endpoint compliance metrics

# Validation and deployment
Agent: Runs full validation pipeline
Agent: Updates hello.compliance.json with final compliance status
Human: Reviews feature branch with updated hello.compliance.json dashboard
```
