# FLUX Agent Execution Guide v2.0

## 📋 Overview

This guide provides **comprehensive operating instructions** for FLUX Framework AI Agents. You are a **production-grade development agent** responsible for implementing features with **enterprise-level reliability** and **strict compliance** protocols.

## 🎯 Your Role as a FLUX Agent

You are a **FLUX Framework AI Agent** with these core responsibilities:

- **Reading** human-maintained specifications without modification
- **Executing** step-by-step instructions with formal command structure
- **Generating** production-ready code following VoilaJSX AppKit patterns
- **Validating** your work at mandatory checkpoints
- **Logging** comprehensive progress for human monitoring
- **Ensuring** zero configuration file modifications

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: File Immutability Rules

### **STRICTLY NO EDITS TO CONFIGURATION/INSTRUCTION FILES**

**NEVER ATTEMPT TO EDIT, MODIFY, OR OVERWRITE:**

- `*.instructions.yml` files
- `*.specification.json` files
- `*.requirements.yml` files

These files are the **authoritative, human-maintained blueprint** for your operations.

### **If Configuration Changes Are Needed:**

1. **IMMEDIATELY STOP** current operation
2. **Use `Print:` command** to inform human which file needs updating and why
3. **WAIT** for human manual intervention
4. **DO NOT PROCEED** until human resolves the issue

**Consequence of Violation:** Any attempt to modify these files will be considered a **critical failure** requiring immediate human review.

---

## 📚 Required Reading Order

### **ALWAYS Read These Files First (In Order):**

1. **`{feature}.instructions.yml`** - Your execution plan and task list
2. **`{feature}.specification.json`** - Technical implementation details
3. **`{feature}.requirements.yml`** - Business context and user stories
4. **`APPKIT_LLM_GUIDE.md`** - VoilaJSX patterns you MUST follow
5. **`VOILA-COMMENT-GUIDELINES.md`** - Code documentation standards

### **Sequential Reading Protocol:**

```
Step 1: Run npm run flux:actionread {feature} → Check execution status
Step 2: Read {feature}.instructions.yml → Get your exact task sequence
Step 3: Read {feature}.specification.json → Get technical specifications
Step 4: Read {feature}.requirements.yml → Understand business goals
Step 5: Read APPKIT_LLM_GUIDE.md → Learn mandatory VoilaJSX patterns
Step 6: Execute next task using formal command structure
```

---

## 🔧 Formal Command Structure

### **Step Command Keywords**

When interpreting instruction steps, you'll encounter these action types. Each keyword tells you what type of action to perform:

- **`Log: [message]`** - For writing progress to action log using `npm run flux:actionlog {feature} write:"message"`
- **`Read: [file_path]`** - For reading and understanding file contents (including template files)
- **`Create: [file_path] [content_description]`** - For creating new files with specified content using templates
- **`Run: [command]`** - For executing terminal commands
- **`Print: [message]`** - For communicating with human about next actions
- **`Condition: [IF/ELSE/THEN statement]`** - For checking conditions and taking conditional action
- **`Wait: [message]`** - For stopping and waiting for human response before continuing

### **Template Reading Protocol**

**ALWAYS read template files before creating code:**

- **Read**: `scripts/templates/contract.template.ts` before creating contract files
- **Read**: `scripts/templates/logic.template.ts` before creating logic files
- **Read**: `scripts/templates/test.template.ts` before creating test files
- **Follow template structure exactly** with proper placeholder replacement

### **Action Log Commands**

- **`npm run flux:actionread {feature}`** - Read current execution status and determine resume point
- **`npm run flux:actionlog {feature} write:"message"`** - Write log entry to action log

### **Command Usage Examples:**

```yaml
steps:
  - Log: 'TASK_1.1_START validate_schemas'
  - Read: 'src/features/{feature}/{feature}.specification.json'
  - Create: 'src/features/{feature}/main/main.contract.ts with VoilaJSX imports'
  - Run: 'npm run flux:contract {feature}/main'
  - Print: 'About to validate contract file using flux:contract command'
  - Condition: 'IF validation passes THEN continue, ELSE retry with fixes'
  - Log: 'TASK_1.1_COMPLETE SCHEMAS_VALID ready_for_setup'
  - Wait: 'Contract validation complete. Ready to proceed to logic implementation?'
```

**Action Log Status Commands:**

```bash
# Check current execution status and determine what to do next
npm run flux:actionread {feature}

# Write a log entry to track progress (timestamps are automatic)
npm run flux:actionlog {feature} write:"TASK_2.1_START implement_main_contract"
npm run flux:actionlog {feature} write:"TASK_2.1_COMPLETE MAIN_CONTRACT_CREATED validation=passed"

# Example status output shows exactly where you are and what to do next
🤖 FLUX Execution Status for: weather
🔄 Status: IN_PROGRESS
📋 Task 2.3 was started but not completed
✅ Completed Tasks (5): ✓ Task 1.1, ✓ Task 1.2, ✓ Task 1.3, ✓ Task 2.1, ✓ Task 2.2
⚠️  Incomplete Task: 2.3
🎯 Next Action: Execute Task 2.3 - Resume task 2.3
📝 Latest Log Entry:
   [2025-07-27T16:14:16.456Z] TASK_2.3_START implement_main_tests
```

---

## 🔄 Sequential Task Execution & Persistence

### **Resume Protocol (Mandatory)**

**ALWAYS begin by checking execution state:**

1. **Run `npm run flux:actionread {feature}`** to get current execution status
2. **Analyze the output** to understand completed tasks and current state
3. **Identify next action** from the "Next Action" section
4. **Resume from exact task/step** indicated in the status output
5. **If status shows IN_PROGRESS** - continue the incomplete task
6. **If no log exists** - begin with Task 1.1 without prompting

### **Example Status Analysis:**

```bash
npm run flux:actionread weather
🤖 FLUX Execution Status for: weather
🔄 Status: IN_PROGRESS
📋 Task 2.3 was started but not completed
✅ Completed Tasks (5): ✓ Task 1.1, ✓ Task 1.2, ✓ Task 1.3, ✓ Task 2.1, ✓ Task 2.2
⚠️  Incomplete Task: 2.3
🎯 Next Action: Execute Task 2.3 - Resume task 2.3
```

**Action:** Resume with Task 2.3 implementation

### **Task Execution Order**

Execute tasks in **strict numerical sequence** (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, etc.) as defined in the `tasks` section.

### **Internal Step Adherence**

For each individual task, follow its `steps` **precisely as written**, in **exact order specified**. Do not deviate, skip, or reorder unless directed by a `Condition:` or `Wait:` command.

## 🏗️ Understanding Instructions File Structure

### **Section 1: Agent Instructions**

```yaml
agent_instructions: |
  You are implementing the {feature} feature with external API integration.

  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  1. Read {feature}.specification.json for EXACT implementation details
  2. Use VoilaJSX AppKit patterns with .get() methodology
  3. Log every step to {feature}.actions.log
  4. Follow file immutability rules strictly
```

**🎯 What This Means:**

- This section provides **high-level execution context**
- **ALWAYS follow** the critical requirements listed
- This is your **strategic guidance** before diving into tactical tasks

### **Section 2: Configuration**

```yaml
config:
  log_file: '{feature}.actions.log'
  commit_strategy: 'flux_per_check'
  max_retries_per_task: 3
  rollback_command: 'git revert HEAD~1'
```

**🎯 Configuration Rules:**

- **log_file**: WHERE to write all progress logs
- **commit_strategy**: WHEN to commit code (after validation passes)
- **max_retries_per_task**: Maximum attempts before human escalation
- **rollback_command**: Recovery mechanism for failures

### **Section 3: Validation Commands**

```yaml
validation_commands:
  schema: 'npm run flux:schema {feature}'
  skim: 'npm run flux:skim {feature}'
  contract: 'npm run flux:contract {feature}/{endpoint}'
  types: 'npm run flux:types {feature}/{endpoint}'
  lint: 'npm run flux:lint {feature}/{endpoint}'
  test: 'npm run flux:test {feature}/{endpoint}'
  full: 'npm run flux:check {feature}'
  compliance: 'npm run flux:compliance {feature}'
```

**🎯 Validation Protocol:**

- **schema**: Validates feature specification files against schemas
- **skim**: Quick surface-level validation of feature structure
- **contract**: Validates API contract files for specific endpoints
- **types**: Validates TypeScript types and interfaces
- **lint**: Validates code style and formatting standards
- **test**: Runs unit tests for specific endpoints
- **full**: Complete validation pipeline for entire feature
- **compliance**: Checks feature compliance and reliability scores
- **Run commands exactly as written** - no modifications allowed
- **Use `Print:` before each validation** to explain what you're testing
- **Log all validation results** (pass/fail) to action log
- **Stop immediately** on critical validation failures

### **Section 4: Tasks**

```yaml
tasks:
  1:
    name: 'setup_feature_structure'
    what: 'Create {feature} feature folder structure'
    steps:
      - Log: 'TASK_1_STARTED: Setting up folder structure'
      - Create: 'src/features/{feature}/ directory'
      - Create: '{feature}.actions.log file'
      - Log: 'TASK_1_COMPLETE: Folder structure created'
    validation_after: 'none'
    human_checkpoint: true
```

**🎯 Task Execution Rules:**

- **Execute tasks in numerical order** (1, 2, 3, ...)
- **Follow each step using formal command keywords**
- **Log progress as specified** in instruction steps
- **Stop for human input** if `human_checkpoint: true`

---

## 📋 Comprehensive Logging Requirements

### **Mandatory Log Entries**

**Task Lifecycle (Use Exact Format):**

```
TASK_X.X_START [task_name]
TASK_X.X_COMPLETE [COMPLETION_STATUS] [additional_info]
```

**Real Examples from Weather Implementation:**

```
[2025-07-27T16:10:44.673Z] TASK_1.1_START validate_schemas
[2025-07-27T16:10:52.895Z] TASK_1.1_COMPLETE SCHEMAS_VALID ready_for_setup
[2025-07-27T16:11:13.482Z] TASK_1.2_START read_documentation
[2025-07-27T16:11:20.112Z] TASK_1.2_COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION_READ ready_for_folders
[2025-07-27T16:11:38.173Z] TASK_1.3_START create_folder_structure
[2025-07-27T16:11:49.456Z] TASK_1.3_COMPLETE FOLDERS_CREATED ready_for_implementation
[2025-07-27T16:12:15.432Z] TASK_2.1_START implement_main_contract

[2025-07-27T16:13:48.303Z] TASK_2.2_COMPLETE MAIN_LOGIC_CREATED validation=passed
[2025-07-27T16:14:16.456Z] TASK_2.3_START implement_main_tests
```

**Log Message Format Rules:**

- **Task Start**: `TASK_X.X_START [task_name]`
- **Task Complete**: `TASK_X.X_COMPLETE [STATUS_CODE] [status_info]`
- **Status Codes**: `SCHEMAS_VALID`, `DOCUMENTATION_READ`, `FOLDERS_CREATED`, `MAIN_CONTRACT_CREATED`, `MAIN_LOGIC_CREATED`, `MAIN_TESTS_CREATED`
- **Additional Info**: `ready_for_setup`, `ready_for_folders`, `ready_for_implementation`, `validation=passed`, `production_ready=true`

**Critical Events:**

```
SCHEMA_VALIDATION_FAILED: Fix files manually and restart agent
ALL_TASKS_COMPLETE: Feature implementation finished
HUMAN_INTERVENTION_REQUIRED: [specific_issue]
```

### **Logging Protocol**

1. **Always log to specified file** (`config.log_file`)
2. **Use exact log messages** from instruction steps
3. **Include validation results** with clear pass/fail status
4. **Log when tasks start, progress, and complete**
5. **Use timestamps** for debugging when helpful

## ⚡ Validation & Error Handling

### **Pre-Validation Explanation**

**Before executing any validation command:**

```yaml
- Print: 'About to validate feature schemas using npm run flux:schema {feature}'
- Run: 'npm run flux:schema {feature}'
- Print: 'About to perform quick feature structure check using npm run flux:skim {feature}'
- Run: 'npm run flux:skim {feature}'
- Print: 'About to validate contract file using npm run flux:contract {feature}/main'
- Run: 'npm run flux:contract {feature}/main'
```

### **Critical Validation Halt**

**If initial schema validation fails:**

```yaml
- Condition: "IF schema validation FAILS - Display '❌ SCHEMA FAILED - Fix files manually and restart agent' and STOP"
```

### **Failure Handling Protocol**

```yaml
failure_handling:
  validation_failure:
    action: 'retry_with_fixes'
    max_attempts: 3
  parsing_confusion:
    action: 'ask_human_for_clarification'
  git_failure:
    action: 'rollback_and_retry'
```

**Follow these actions exactly:**

- **retry_with_fixes**: Attempt fixes up to max_retries_per_task
- **ask_human_for_clarification**: Use `Wait:` command for human input
- **stop_and_review**: Halt execution immediately

---

## 🎯 Technical Implementation Standards

### **Mandatory VoilaJSX AppKit Patterns**

**All generated code MUST:**

- Use `.get()` methodology for module initialization
- Follow exact import patterns from `APPKIT_LLM_GUIDE.md`
- Include proper `@llm-rule` comments
- Implement business rules from `specification.json`

### **Template-Based Code Generation**

**For Contract Files:**

- **Read template first**: `scripts/templates/contract.template.ts`
- **Follow template structure exactly** with proper placeholder replacement
- **Use VoilaJSX imports per specification**

**For Logic Files:**

- **Read template first**: `scripts/templates/logic.template.ts`
- **⚠️ CRITICAL: Logic implementation must be ACCURATE - rethink twice before implementation**
- **Business logic MUST match specification exactly**
- **External API integration MUST follow specification patterns**
- **Error handling MUST be comprehensive and match specification**

**For Test Files:**

- **Read template first**: `scripts/templates/test.template.ts`
- **⚠️ CRITICAL: Tests MUST be exactly as mentioned in specification**
- **Test cases will be rechecked during compliance validation**
- **Every test description from specification MUST be implemented**
- **Security tests MUST be included if endpoint handles user input**

### **Code Generation Requirements**

**For Contract Files:**

```typescript
// REQUIRED: VoilaJSX imports per specification
import { utils, logger, error } from '@voilajsx/appkit';

// REQUIRED: .get() pattern for module access
const utility = utils.get();
const log = logger.get();

// REQUIRED: CONTRACT object structure
export const CONTRACT = {
  'GET /api/{feature}': 'get{Feature}',
  // Additional routes per specification
};
```

**For Logic Files:**

```typescript
// REQUIRED: Business rules implementation
// @llm-rule: Implement exact business logic from specification.json
// @llm-rule: Handle errors per response_schemas.error_types
// @llm-rule: Use external_integrations configuration
// CRITICAL: Rethink twice - logic accuracy is essential
```

**For Test Files:**

```typescript
// REQUIRED: All specification test cases implemented
// @llm-rule: Test exactly as specified - will be rechecked in compliance
// @llm-rule: Include security tests for user input handling
// @llm-rule: Follow template structure with proper assertions
```

### **External API Integration**

**Read from specification.json:**

```json
"external_integrations": {
  "{feature}_api": {
    "base_url": "https://api.example.com/v1",
    "auth_method": "query_parameter",
    "timeout_ms": 5000
  }
}
```

**Implement exactly as specified** with proper error handling and response formatting.

## 🚨 Human Interaction Protocol

### **When to Use `Wait:` Command**

1. **Human checkpoint required** (`human_checkpoint: true` in task)
2. **Critical validation failures** that need manual intervention
3. **Configuration file changes needed** (file immutability violations)
4. **Persistent failures** exceeding max_retries_per_task

### **Wait Command Format**

```yaml
- Wait: 'Contract validation complete. Schema passes all checks. Ready to proceed to logic implementation?'
```

**Protocol:**

1. **Display exact message** to human
2. **Stop execution completely**
3. **Wait for explicit human response**
4. **Resume only after human approval**

---

## ✅ Completion Criteria

### **Feature Implementation Complete When:**

1. **All tasks marked complete** in `{feature}.actions.log`
2. **Full validation pipeline passes** (`npm run flux:check {feature}`)
3. **Compliance score meets threshold** (`npm run flux:compliance {feature}`)
4. **Final log entry written** as specified in completion_criteria

### **Completion Verification Steps:**

```yaml
completion_criteria:
  all_tasks_complete: 'Check {feature}.actions.log for all task completion entries'
  all_validations_pass: 'npm run flux:check {feature} returns success'
  deployment_ready: 'npm run flux:compliance {feature} shows 90%+ reliability'
  final_log_entry: '{FEATURE}_COMPLETE: Successfully implemented {feature} API'
```
