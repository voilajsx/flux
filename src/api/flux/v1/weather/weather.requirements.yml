# BUSINESS OVERVIEW
# ============================================================================

purpose: 'Provide accurate real-time weather information for users to make informed decisions about their activities'
business_value: 'Enhance user experience by providing contextual weather data for location-based decisions'
target_users: 'Mobile app users, web dashboard users, and API consumers'

# ============================================================================
# WHAT WE NEED
# ============================================================================

user_stories:
  - story: 'As a user in Hyderabad, I want to quickly check current weather so I can plan my day'
    acceptance: 'Show current weather for Hyderabad by default when no location specified'
    example: 'GET /api/weather returns Hyderabad weather: 28Â°C, Sunny, Humidity 65%'

  - story: 'As a user, I want to check weather for any city so I can plan travel or remote activities'
    acceptance: 'Accept city name in URL and return accurate weather data for that location'
    example: 'GET /api/weather/mumbai returns Mumbai weather with temperature, conditions, humidity'

  - story: 'As a developer, I want consistent API responses so I can reliably integrate weather data'
    acceptance: 'Return standardized JSON format with error handling for invalid locations'
    example: 'Invalid location returns 404 with clear error message, valid locations return consistent data structure'

# ============================================================================
# BUSINESS RULES
# ============================================================================

business_rules:
  - 'Default location is Hyderabad when no location parameter provided'
  - 'Weather data must be current (less than 1 hour old)'
  - 'Invalid location names return proper error responses'
  - 'API should handle common city name variations (Mumbai/Bombay, etc.)'
  - 'Response time must be under 2 seconds for all requests'

# ============================================================================
# SUCCESS METRICS
# ============================================================================

success_metrics:
  user_experience:
    - 'Average response time under 1.5 seconds'
    - 'Error rate below 2% for valid locations'
    - 'User satisfaction with weather accuracy above 85%'
  business_impact:
    - 'API usage growth of 20% month-over-month'
    - 'Reduced customer support tickets about weather features'
    - 'Increased user engagement with location-based features'

# ============================================================================
# TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
# ============================================================================

technical_requirements:
  integrations:
    - 'External weather API service (OpenWeather, WeatherAPI, or similar)'
  performance:
    sla: '99.5% uptime'
    response_time: 'Under 2 seconds'
    throughput: '1000 requests per minute'
  security_level: 'medium'

# ============================================================================
# CONSTRAINTS & RISKS
# ============================================================================

constraints:
  - 'Must use external weather API within rate limits'
  - 'Cannot store weather data for more than 1 hour due to accuracy requirements'
  - 'Must handle API key management securely'

business_risks:
  external_dependency:
    risk: 'Weather API service downtime or rate limiting'
    impact: 'Users cannot access weather information'
    mitigation: 'Implement caching, fallback APIs, and proper error messaging'

  data_accuracy:
    risk: 'Outdated or inaccurate weather data'
    impact: 'Poor user experience and loss of trust'
    mitigation: 'Regular data freshness validation and multiple data source options'
